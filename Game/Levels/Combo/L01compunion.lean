Title "Complement of a union"

Introduction
"
As the proofs get harder, you may sometimes find that you want to use the `have` tactic
to assert a statement whose proof is too hard to do in a single line.  For an explanation
of how to do that, click on `have` in the list of tactics on the right.

"For any sets `A` and `B`, `comp_union A B` is a proof of the
statement `(A ∪ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∩ Bᶜ`."
