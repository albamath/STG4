Introduction
"
To work with intersections, we'll need to understand the word \"and\".

If `P` and `Q` are statements, then `P ∧ Q` means \"P and Q\".  To enter the
symbol `∧`, type `\\and`.  For the statement `P ∧ Q` to be true, `P` and `Q` must
both be true.  If you have `h : P ∧ Q`--that is, `h` is a proof of
the statement `P ∧ Q`--then in Lean, `h.left` is a proof of `P` and `h.right` is
a proof of `Q`.  That should be all you need to know to solve this level.
