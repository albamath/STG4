World "Intersection"
Level 2
Title "Element of an intersection"

Introduction
"
In this level, we'll need to use the definition of \"intersection\".  The theorem that
expresses that definition is called `inter_def`.  If you have `x : U`, `A : Set U`, and
`B : Set U`, then `inter_def x A B` is a proof of the statement `x ∈ A ∩ B ↔ x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B`.
As we saw in Complement World, that means that the tactic `rewrite [inter_def x A B]` can be
used to replace `x ∈ A ∩ B` in the goal with `x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B`.  Usually Lean can figure out
`x`, `A`, and `B` on its own, so you can just write `rewrite [inter_def]`, and you can
use `rewrite [inter_def] at h` to do the replacement in an assumption `h` rather than
the goal.

Like `comp_def`, `inter_def` can be proven by using the `rfl` tactic.  But we
won't ask you to prove it; it is pre-defined in this game.  To enter the symbol `∩`, you
can type `\\inter` or `\\cap`.

"If `A` and `B` are sets, then `A ∩ B` is the intersection of `A` and `B`.
To enter the symbol `∩`, type `\\inter` or `\\cap`."
